# Overview
Welcome to the Staking smart contract repository on Bitlink Chain! This repository is dedicated to the development of a smart contract for staking BTLK tokens on the Bitlink Chain blockchain. Staking allows users to lock their BTLK tokens in the contract and earn rewards in return for contributing to the network's security and consensus.

## Smart Contract Functions
The Staking smart contract should implement the following functions:

1. Stake: Allow users to stake their BTLK tokens in the contract and become eligible for staking rewards.

2. Unstake: Allow users to unstake their tokens and withdraw them from the contract after a specific lock-up period.

3. Claim Rewards: Allow users to claim their staking rewards accrued during the staking period.

4. Get Staking Balance: Return the staking balance of a specific user.

5. Get Staking Reward: Return the accumulated staking rewards of a specific user.

6. Get Total Staked Tokens: Return the total number of BTLK tokens staked in the contract.

7. Get Total Staking Rewards: Return the total amount of staking rewards available in the contract.
